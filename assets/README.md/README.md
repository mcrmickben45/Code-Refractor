AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

For this assignment, we were asked to revise existing code for the website, Horiseon, so that the code would be more accessible and recognizable to search engines, like Google. I was able to revise the code so that the CSS was condensed and less redundant in its coding. Additionally, I made the title section more descriptive, added semantic elements to the structure of the body, and added accessible alt attributes to images without changing the cosmetic view of the site.
