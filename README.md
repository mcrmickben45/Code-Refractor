## Introduction

Websites want a codebase that follows accessibility standards, so that their website is optimized for search engines. Accessibility standards are met in order to provide access to website visitors with disabilities and those requiring assistive technologies. Meeting accessibility standards also optimizes search engines to promote the site to users, such as Google or Bing. In Horiseon's instance, it was imperative to reformat the code following sequential and logical semantic HTML practices to improve the flow and specificity of content sections. We achieve this by reviewing the logical structures independent of style and positioning, reviewing image elements, etc., and changing div properties with semantic elements, such as "div class = header" which can be replaced by just a "header" tag, and reviewing the respective CSS properties. Additionally, this is done by verifying working links and appropriately attributed images and media to the website. However, with this being done, the site still needs to be coded to provide more stable structuring across all platforms to be increase the longetivity of the site.

## Usage
1. Open the Horiseon URL in browser.
2. Use the navigation bar to access website content. 
3. Click on the navigation headers to access specific content, e.g. "Search Engine Optimization," "Online Reputation Management," "Social Media Marketing."

## Configuration
Built using:
- HTML
